# HandMeDown
A social media engagement project to promote sustainability in the fashion industry and encourage the preservation of lineage through garments.

A user can create an original QR code for each individual garment. The code can then be printed to iron-on paper and applied to the inside of the shirt (ideally by the back collar). This unique code will allow users to share where their garment is located, major life events/stories attached to the garment, and follow that garment’s stories as it is passed from user to user. MVP will focus on a target demo of young parents to share the stories of their children’s clothes - items that are usually owned for a short period of time ( 2 months on average ).
